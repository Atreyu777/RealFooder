## Iteration 1: delete items

- On the foods list, show a delete button for those products whose owner is the logged in user. 
- When clicked, the food must be removed from the database (you have the `https://reactr-realfooder.herokuapp.com/api/foods/delete/:id` endopoint for this, through the `DELETE` HTTP method)

- After removed from the database, the product list must be refresed:

## Iteration 2: edit items

- On the foods list, show an edit button for those products whose owner is the logged in user. 
- When clicked, a modal window containing the product's info must appear. Reuse for this the same Form component and the same Bootstrap's Modal Window you developed to create new products, and don't forget to change the submit button text when editing!
- After saving the edited item, the product list must be refresed:
