## Iteration 1: delete items

- On the foods list, show a delete button for those products whose owner is the logged in user. 
- When clicked, the food must be removed from the database (you have the `https://reactr-realfooder.herokuapp.com/api/foods/delete/:id` endopoint for this, through the `DELETE` HTTP method)

- After removed from the database, the product list must be refresed:<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Iteration 2: edit items

- On the foods list, show an edit button for those products whose owner is the logged in user. 
- When clicked, a modal window containing the product's info must appear. Reuse for this the same Form component and the same Bootstrap's Modal Window you developed to create new products.
- Don't forget to change both the modal window title and the submit button text when editing.
- After saving the edited item, the product list must be refresed:<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Iteration 3: info toast

- Create a info toast component with a similar appearance as the showed below. Do not use any existing component (NPM, Bootstrap...), instead create it manually.
- The info toast should appear when any of the actions are completed (_new item created successfully, item deleted sucessfully, item edited succesfully_):<p>&nbsp;</p>
